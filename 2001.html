    <p>Have you always admired military men? Do you want to be one of them in the future? Getting a career in the armed forces could be truly rewarding and promising. Soldiers are considered living heroes no matter what country you are in. That is because such men in service are always risking their lives to defend and protect the interest of the country and the government. They fight invaders and they help make sure the overall peace and orderliness in the society would be in its proper order. It is truly a noble deed to join the military.</p>
    <p>If you want to be part of the armed forces, do not suppress your feelings. Get on to realize your ambition now. Enlist in the military and be trained to be a part of the service. It is not as exhilarating and as tiring as it seems. But it is truly rewarding enough. If you have the drive and the passion, you would not mind subjecting yourself into much disciplinary action. Besides, many men and women attest the military training makes them more of better people. You would learn how to strive more to attain excellence, honor, and integrity.</p>

    <p>What does it take to be in the military? Here is a simple checklist that could help guide you as you contemplate to decide whether you would go and proceed to join the service or just find other professions that could suit your personality and personal purpose.</p>
    <p>Nationalism. You would not make a good solider if you do not love the country. You have to defend the nation, its government, and its people from internal and external forces that threaten them. You have to be loyal and patriotic to make it better. This could serve as you basic motivation along the way.</p>
    <p>Determination. The road to being a military person is often rough and relentless. That is why you should be determined enough to make it. You should be decisive and firm to stand by the important decisions you make. Without this trait in your personality, it would certainly be hard and even impossible for you to attain your goals, as always.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Physical endurance. As mentioned, the training to become a soldier could be rigorous and exhilarating. You would be subjected to a series of physical examinations to make sure you are physically qualified and ready to make it. Long physical training could be essential and necessary.</p>
    <p>Intelligence. You should not think the military is just after physical endurance and agility. You should of course have sharp mind and healthy line of thinking. Battles fought by the military involve so much mental exhilaration as well. That is why you should prepare well for it. You would need to study and to learn more.</p>
    <p>Luck. This one is quite relative. You could not measure your luck but you could bet on it. Just be focused on your goal to join the armed forces and intend to run until the finish line. If you make it, then luck is in your hands and if not, you could keep on going or divert to another profession.</p>
