    <p>There is a special day designated in the United States for commemorating and appreciating al the sacrifices and contributions of the military to the society and to nation building. This is called the Armed Forces Day. It is regarded as an important occasion in the national scene. Observed every third week of May since 1949, the holiday is expected to continue giving people more insights and opportunities to realize how noble and how great the profession of the military could get.</p>
    <p>Armed Forces Day is a special day assigned for the commemoration and recognition of soldiers&rsquo; unique and necessary sacrifices for the good of all. Many countries and governments all over the planet are holding annual Armed Forces Day as a way of venerating and honoring their respective military forces. Thus, the day is considered an important and emotional one for many soldiers. They are human, too. They have basic needs and they have families who are always standing behind them through thick and thin. In many cases, the day is used not just to honor the soldiers but also to honor the families and people that are behind them along the way.</p>

    <p>The US is more sentimental of its veneration to its soldiers. It has been celebrating and commemorating Armed Forces Day since 1949. Every year, the country vows to its soldiers every third Saturday of May. The date also commemorates the consolidation of the US Department of Defense&rsquo;s military services. The celebration is usually observed through staging of parades, air shows, receptions, and open houses. In 2009, the country observed its 50th Armed Forces Day. The celebration centered in Torrance, California, where there was the longest-running commemoration co-sponsored by the city.</p>
    <p>How could you help celebrate and commemorate this day more impressively and significantly? Here are some effective ideas that could help you freshen up and do uniquely but sensibly on the important holiday date. You do not need to be in the military to enjoy the celebration. There are just too many things you could do as an ordinary civilian.</p>
    <p>First, consider attending an open house that is commemorating the Armed Forces Day. You could drop by the nearest military base that is nearest to you. While there, strive to talk to men and women who are on duty. Do not forget to be nice and friendly. As questions and then learn to like that you are selling and marketing.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Second, drop by an Armed Forces Day Blast. Such events are open to scouts so if you have one in the family you are set. You could also go with friends who have scout relatives if you do not have scouts in your family. Go see the pinewood, the sport competitions, the derbies, kite flying, and other activities.</p>
    <p>You could have more meaningful alternatives. Contribute to preservation of historic forts in your area instead. You could always volunteer to cleanup or simply help in the overall holiday celebration or preparation. Lend your hand to the commemoration of the Armed Forces Day so you could exhibit your cooperation.Â </p>
