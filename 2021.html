    <p>The United State military or armed forces are the unified body of all military forces in the country. It was first established in the second Continental Congress in aim of defending the then emerging and newly formed nation from the British Empire during the American Revolutionary War. In 1775, the Marine Corps, Navy, and Army were commissioned in anticipation of pending declaration of independence the following year. In 1790, the Coast Guard was formed originally as the Revenue Cutter Service. It was a long way before the US military emerged to become what it is today, the greatest and most powerful military body in the world, or probably the universe.</p>

    <p>The structure is basically familiar to all. The President serves as the commander-in-chief. The Department of Defense serves as the major organ that carries out the overall military policy of the country. After the September terrorist attacks, the Department of Homeland Security was formed to consolidate and coordinate civilian military contributions to counter internal and external national threats. The US armed forces is the force to reckon, admired, respected, and looked up to by all other military bodies in the world.</p>
    <p>Currently, the US military is being comprised of up to three million personnel. About half of those are in the reserve. Because of its great scale and volume, it is not surprising that the US armed forces has the record of being among the biggest military organizations in the world in terms of total number of personnel. It draws its basic manpower from a huge pool of military volunteers. Conscription is therefore not a present source of personnel. About $711 billion of funds every year is received by the US military every year in the form of funds that constitute up to half of global military expenses.</p>
    <p>As a whole, the US force owns huge quantities of modern and sophisticated warfare equipment. These powerful machineries further make the military more forceful and authoritative. The equipment makes the US military superior in terms of power projection and defense. It should be observed that annually, a significant fraction of the country&rsquo;s budget is allocated to further advancement and procurement of more military assets and gadgets. The reach of the armed forces is continuously extending, reaching as far as the other continents. Through the years, the US military has built its strong portfolio of reliable equipment and weaponry.</p>

    <p>It is the utmost dream of most American males to be part of the military. Women also start to do the same. In fact, part of the current evolution of the US Armed Forces is the inclusion of women as officers. Female soldier are given more opportunities and responsibilities now. This is not in any way surprising because for some time, the institution and the rest of the country has been actively fighting off and curtailing discrimination in any form.</p>
    <p>Even gays and lesbians could now find their selves equal opportunities in the military. Thus, the US force is a great and superior one.</p>
