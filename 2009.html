    <p>The skies are a beautiful testament of how good life can be when all things are calm and tranquil. But when dark clouds and black smoke start to block the horizon morale is easily degraded and people tend to look for someone or something they can turn to. In the United States people can look up for protection and security from one of the service of the Armed Forces which is called the Air Force.</p>
    <p>The United States Air Force or USAF is the brand of armed force that deals with conflicts revolving around issues of aerial warfare and territorial conflicts. Before, the USAF was considered to be part of the United States Army, but then it separated to form an independent military branch on September 18, 1947. It is identified as the youngest division in the US Military.</p>

    <p>The US Air Force offers critical capacities regarding aspects of Global Vigilance, Global Power, and Global Reach. It is composed of 5,573 manned aircraft in active service; around 180 unmanned combat aerial vehicles, 2,130 air-launched cruise missiles, and 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. Its manpower resource is comprised of 327,452 personnel who are on active duty, 115,299 within the Selected and Individual Ready Reserves, and 106,700 as part of the Air National Guard. There are also around 171,313 civilian personnel employed in the Air Force.</p>
    <p>The Department of the Air Force is under the authority of a civilian Secretary of the Air Force who has the task of facilitating all the policy and administrative affairs of the organization. The Department of the Air Force is considered to be part of the Department of Defense which is led by the Secretary of Defense. The officer who has the highest rank within the Department of the Air Force is named as the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.</p>

    <p>The National Security Act of 1947 states the general objective of the service which says that the USAF was organized in order to undergo organized and equipped training to serve in purposeful offensive and defensive air operations. The Air Force is tasked to prepare necessary means that can be employed in order to eliminate the existence of war as well as coordinate with other agencies and act on mobilized plans for the promotion of peacetime components.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the US Code the USAF has the purpose involving the preservation of peace and security and provision of defense to the US, its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. It also has obligations to support national policies, implement national objectives, and overcome any nations responsible for aggressive acts that compromise the peace and safety of the United States. At present, the stated mission of the USAF can be summarized as fly, fight, and win in air, space, and cyberspace.</p>
    <p>The National Search and Rescue Plan appointed the USAF as the one responsible for keeping close attention to aeronautical search and rescue within the continental US with the exception of Alaska. It works hand in hand with the coast guard to maintain Joint Rescue Coordination Centers. There are also instances when the Air Force can be assigned to aeronautical responsibilities outside that of the US.</p>
    <p>Peace should be present all over the boundaries and territories of a nation. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it is on land, water, or the sky. What really matters is that there is coordinated and organized effort from each nation&rsquo;s armed forces.</p>
